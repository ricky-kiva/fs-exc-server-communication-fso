# Communicating with Server

## Web Programmers Oath

As my lecturer said; Programming is hard, that is why I will use all the possible means to make it easier

- I will have my browser developer console open all the time
- I progress with small steps
- I will write lots of console.log statements to make sure I understand how the code behaves and to help pinpointing problems
- If my code does not work, I will not write more code. Instead I start deleting the code until it works or just return to a state when everything was still working
- When I ask for help in the course Discord or Telegram channel or elsewhere I formulate my questions properly, see here how to ask for help
